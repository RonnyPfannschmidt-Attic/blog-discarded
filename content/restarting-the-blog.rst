Restarting the Blog
===================

**Hello Again**

After a few years of studying and hiatus i decided to restart my Blog.

It's been quite a while since i last wrote and I'm getting up to the task again.
I'm slowly getting started to write again and i want to extend my skills,
since im rather unhappy with my general writing and documentation skills.

The basic plan is to get back at writing about the tools i like/dislike
and to propose ideas to the world helping me develop my writing step by step.

I also included some of the older posts i considered as nice to have.

Well, the initial site is up, more is to follow.

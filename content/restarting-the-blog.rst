**Hello Again**

After a few years of studying and hiatus i decided to restart my Blog.
It's been quite a while since i last wrote and I'm getting up to the task again.
I'm slowly getting started to write again and i want to extend my skills,
since im rather unhappy with my general writing and documentation skills.

The basic plan is to get back at writing about the tools i like/dislike
and to propose ideas to the world helping me develop my writing step by step.

As a questionable bonus i recoverd most of my old post from my first blog,
all of which happened when i was a raging student.


Im still auditing those and i'll beon releasing them in the weeks to come
along with new content and writeups.

ugly and nasty - getting abstractions from views to using and creating
======================================================================

In my last Post i described the abstraction structures to deal with viewing vcs history.<br>
What i didn't handle was how to make it actually usable for making those things usable for endusers

This has a simple reason - not only the branching patterns are different - the difference on how you deal with repositories, "workingsets" and branches are even more nasty  if you do things like get a project from remote, create new local/remote branches and of course creating commits, merges and communicating those.

The common vcs's create a whole new level of complexity in that area
